## Building

### Prerequisites

Before building, you should have:

1. Flutter SDK installed
2. [matrix-dart-sdk](https://github.com/ExteraApp/matrix-dart-sdk) in the same directory as Extera

### Setup

The `matrix` dependency can be configured in two ways:

**Way 1: Directory-based (recommended when developing both app & sdk)**
Make sure that you have `matrix-dart-sdk` cloned in the same parent directory.

```
$ ls
Extera    matrix-dart-sdk
```

**Option 2: Git reference**
Make sure that `pubspec.yaml` has a Git reference like this:

```yaml
matrix:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/ExteraApp/matrix-dart-sdk.git
    ref: main
```

### Build Commands

Platform-specific build scripts are available in the `scripts/` directory:

- `./scripts/build-appimage.sh` - AppImage (Linux)
- `./scripts/build-linux.sh` - Linux (Run only after build-appimage.sh)
- `.\scripts\build-windows.ps1` - Windows

#### Prerequisites

##### Windows

Before building on Windows, install the following:

- **[Visual Studio Build Tools 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#visual-studio-2022-tools)** (or newer) with the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload — provides MSVC compiler and Windows SDK.
- **[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)**
- **[Rust](https://rustup.rs)** (`rustup`)
- **[NASM](https://www.nasm.us/)**
- **[OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)**
- **[Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows)**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> 1. Make sure to run build as admin.
> 2. If you are in Russia, you won't be able to download some dependencies, what will result in build failure. Use helper programs which 'alter your internet traffic'.
